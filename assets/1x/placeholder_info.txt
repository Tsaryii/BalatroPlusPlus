Currently Using Placeholder Sprites from Vanilla Joker Atlas:

- Whiteboard: Uses pos {x=0, y=0} (Joker sprite)
- Eques: Uses pos {x=1, y=0} (Greedy Joker sprite)  
- Petrified Joker: Uses pos {x=2, y=0} (Lusty Joker sprite)

Future Custom Images Needed (71x95 pixels):
- j_whiteboard.png - A white/clean joker (opposite of Blackboard's dark theme)
- j_eques.png - A knight-themed joker with medieval/armor elements
- j_petrified_joker.png - A stone/crystal joker that looks patient/waiting

Instructions for Custom Art:
- Use Balatro's art style: pixel art with clean lines
- 71x95 pixel dimensions for 1x assets
- Use Balatro's color palette
- Whiteboard: Clean, bright, with red suit symbols (Hearts/Diamonds), opposite of Blackboard
- Eques: Knight/medieval theme with crown elements (upgrades to King)
- Petrified: Stone/crystal texture, maybe with crack lines showing gradual growth
