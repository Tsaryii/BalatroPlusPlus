# Totally Balanced Cards

A Balatro mod featuring unique jokers with interesting mechanics and interactions!

## Jokers Included

### **Whiteboard** (Uncommon - $6)
- **Effect:** X3 Mult if hand contains no Spades or Clubs (can mix Hearts and Diamonds)
- **Strategy:** The opposite of Blackboard - rewards avoiding black suits
- **Synergy:** Works well with red-suit focused decks and Vampire

### **Eques** (Uncommon - $5)  
- **Effect:** All played face cards count as Kings
- **Strategy:** Upgrades Jacks and Queens to Kings for scoring
- **Synergy:** Incredible with King-dependent jokers or strategies

### **Petrified Joker** (Uncommon - $6)
- **Effect:** Gains +0.1X Mult each time you discard 1-2 cards, resets when discarding 3+ cards
- **Strategy:** Rewards conservative, strategic discarding
- **Balance:** Encourages careful hand management vs aggressive cycling

## Design Philosophy

These jokers are designed to be:
- **Interesting mechanically**: Each has a unique effect not found in base game
- **Balanced**: Powerful but with clear conditions or trade-offs
- **Build-enabling**: They encourage specific playstyles and strategies
- **Interactive**: They change how you think about hand management

## Detailed Mechanics

### Whiteboard
- Checks all cards currently held in hand (not just played cards)
- Activates when hand contains NO Spades or Clubs (can mix Hearts and Diamonds)
- Similar power level to Blackboard but for avoiding black suits
- Great for Abandoned Deck or red-suit focused builds

### Eques  
- Makes all played face cards (Jacks, Queens, Kings) count as Kings
- Works with any joker that cares about Kings or face cards
- "Eques" is Latin for "knight" - upgrades all knights to kings
- Enables King-based strategies and higher face card scoring

### Petrified Joker
- Starts at X1 Mult, grows by +0.1X each conservative discard
- "Conservative discard" = discarding exactly 1 or 2 cards
- Resets to X1 when you discard 3 or more cards at once
- Rewards patient, strategic play over aggressive cycling
- Can grow quite powerful with careful management (X2, X3, X4+)
